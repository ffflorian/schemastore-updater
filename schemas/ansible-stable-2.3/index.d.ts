Authentication details required by the remote server must be provided as well. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

       * This module allows you to work with the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a set of CNOS commands on a switch by evaluating the current running configuration and executing the commands only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The configuration source can be a set of commands or a template written in the Jinja2 templating language. This module functions the same as the cnos_template module. The only exception is that the following inventory variable can be specified [“condition = <flag string>”] When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a task, the template is executed for the network element that matches the flag string. Usually, templates are used when commands are the same across a group of network devices. When there is a requirement to skip the execution of the template on one or more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.

       * This module allows you to work with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) related configurations. The operators used are overloaded to ensure control over switch BGP configurations. This module is invoked using method with asNumber as one of its arguments. The first level of the BGP configuration allows to set up an AS number, with the following attributes going into various configuration operations under the context of BGP. After passing this level, there are eight BGP arguments that will perform further configurations. They are bgpArg1, bgpArg2, bgpArg3, bgpArg4, bgpArg5, bgpArg6, bgpArg7, and bgpArg8. For more details on how to use these arguments, see [Overloaded Variables]. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.

       * This module allows you to modify the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a single CNOS command on a network device by evaluating the current running configuration and executing the command only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The CNOS command is passed as an argument of the method. This module functions the same as the cnos_command module. The only exception is that the following inventory variable can be specified [“condition = <flag string>”] When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a task, the command is executed for the network element that matches the flag string. Usually, commands are executed across a group of network devices. When there is a requirement to skip the execution of the command on one or more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.
