 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * An abstract method with a trivial body has no concrete implementation to execute, so calling such a
 * method directly on the class will probably not have the desired effect.
 *
 * It is also unsound to call these methods directly on the class. Unlike other methods, ty permits
 * abstract methods with trivial bodies to have non-`None` return types even though they always return
 * `None` at runtime. This is because it is expected that these methods will always be overridden
 * rather than being called directly. As a result of this exception to the normal rule, ty may infer an
 * incorrect type if one of these methods is called directly, which may then mean that type errors
 * elsewhere in your code go undetected by ty.

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects `cast` calls where the inferred type of the value is disjoint from the destination type.
 *
 * Two types are disjoint if they are entirely non-overlapping. For example, `str` and `int` are
 * disjoint types because it is impossible to create a Python object that is both a `str` and an `int`
 * at the same time: Python forbids multiple inheritance between these two classes:
 *
 * ```pycon
 * >>> class StrAndInt(int, str): ...
 * Traceback (most recent call last):
 *   File "<python-input-0>", line 1, in <module>
 *     class StrAndInt(int, str): ...
 * TypeError: multiple bases have instance lay-out conflict
 * ```
 *
 * This means that any object of type `int` can never also be of type `str`, and any object of type
 * `str` can never also inhabit the type `int`. The only common subtype of these two types is
 * [`Never`][never], the uninhabited type, which has no members.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * `cast()` is deliberately designed as an "escape hatch" in the type system that is neither validated
 * at runtime nor, by default, by type checkers. While upcasting to a supertype is always sound, and
 * casting to a subtype can be sound in some situations if accompanied by careful validation checks,
 * `cast()` is also deliberately designed to allow unsound narrowing, and most useful applications of
 * `cast()` in real-world code cannot be fully validated by a type checker.
 *
 * Nonetheless, even while acknowledging the fact that `cast()` is intentionally designed to allow
 * unsoundness, casting a value to an entirely *disjoint* type is especially likely to indicate a
 * mistake in your code. A cast from an `int` to a `str`, for example, likely indicates a bug or
 * misunderstanding.
 *
 * This rule therefore provides a means for codebases to partially validate their uses of `cast()`
 * without banning the API -- or even banning all unsound uses of the API -- entirely.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import cast
 *
 *
 * def parse(value: int) -> str:
 *     return cast(str, value)  # error: [disjoint-cast]
 * ```
 *
 * Casts between overlapping (non-disjoint) types are allowed:
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Sequence
 * from typing import cast
 *
 *
 * def validate(numbers: Sequence[int | None]) -> Sequence[int]:
 *     if None in numbers:
 *         raise TypeError("must provide a sequence of numbers!")
 *     return cast(Sequence[int], numbers)
 * ```
 *
 * Note that disjointness between types can sometimes be surprising. For example, `list[int]` is
 * disjoint from `list[bool]` even though `bool` is a subtype of `int`. Due to the fact that `list` is
 * [mutable and invariant], it would be deeply unsound for ty to ever narrow an object of type
 * `list[int]` to the type `list[bool]`. As such, ty will complain about a cast from `list[int]` to
 * `list[bool]` when this rule is enabled.
 *
 * Similarly, two `NewType`s can be disjoint even when they share the same underlying nominal base
 * type, unless one `NewType` is explicitly declared as a sub-newtype of the other.
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import NewType, cast
 *
 *
 * UserId = NewType("UserId", int)
 * ProUserId = NewType("ProUserId", int)
 *
 *
 * def f(x: list[int], user_id: UserId):
 *     y = cast(list[bool], x)  # error: [disjoint-cast]
 *     pro_user_id = cast(ProUserId, user_id)  # error: [disjoint-cast]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Alternatives
 *
 * In many cases, the diagnostic can be avoided by switching to use covariant generic types rather than
 * invariant ones:
 *
 * ```py
 * # `Sequence`, unlike `list`, is immutable and covariant
 * from collections.abc import Sequence
 * from typing import cast
 *
 *
 * def f(x: Sequence[int]):
 *     y = cast(Sequence[bool], x)  # no diagnostic
 * ```
 *
 * Though if you're able to use covariant types, a type-safe narrowing mechanism that provides runtime
 * validation, such as using `TypeIs`, is generally preferable to using `cast`:
 *
 * ```py
 * # `Sequence`, unlike `list`, is immutable and covariant
 * from collections.abc import Sequence
 * from typing_extensions import TypeIs, reveal_type
 *
 *
 * def is_sequence_of_bools(x: Sequence[int]) -> TypeIs[Sequence[bool]]:
 *     return all(isinstance(item, bool) for item in x)
 *
 *
 * def f(x: Sequence[int]):
 *     assert is_sequence_of_bools(x)
 *     reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Sequence[bool]
 * ```
 *
 * If you're unable to switch to an immutable, covariant generic type, other solutions to this
 * particular diagnostic might include assigning a new list altogether:
 *
 * ```py
 * def f(x: list[int]):
 *     y: list[bool] = []
 *     for item in x:
 *         assert isinstance(item, bool)
 *         y.append(item)
 * ```
 *
 * Or using a `TypeGuard`. While the "narrowing" below is still unsound, there is at least some runtime
 * validation of the element types taking place, making it superior to the `cast`:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing_extensions import TypeGuard, reveal_type
 *
 *
 * def is_list_of_bools(x: list[int]) -> TypeGuard[list[bool]]:
 *     return all(isinstance(item, bool) for item in x)
 *
 *
 * def f(x: list[int]):
 *     assert is_list_of_bools(x)
 *     reveal_type(x)  # revealed: list[bool]
 * ```

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects decorator applications that replace a function with `Any` or another [dynamic type].
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * A decorator can replace the function it receives with any object. Type checkers therefore use the
 * decorator's return type as the type of the decorated function. If the decorator returns `Any` or
 * `Unknown` (explicitly or implicitly), the original type is lost, along with the type checker's
 * ability to catch invalid calls and attribute accesses:
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Callable
 *
 *
 * def untyped_decorator(function: Callable[..., object]):
 *     return function
 *
 *
 * # error: "Decorator returns `Unknown`"
 * @untyped_decorator
 * def stringify(value: int) -> str:
 *     return str(value)
 *
 *
 * # No type error is reported, even though `stringify` expects an integer.
 * stringify("not an integer")
 * ```
 *
 * This rule identifies the point where a decorator erases useful type information, before that
 * imprecision spreads to every use of the decorated function. It can be especially useful in cases
 * where the decorator is defined in a third-party library. Whereas linter rules such as
 * [`ANN201`][ann201] and [`ANN202`][ann202] can complain about missing annotations in your first-party
 * code, they cannot identify instances where unsound types leak into your code due to missing type
 * annotations in third-party code installed into `site-packages`.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * `third_party_library.py`:
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Callable
 *
 *
 * def untyped_decorator(function: Callable[..., object]):
 *     return function
 * ```
 *

 *
 *
 * # error: "Decorator returns `Unknown`"
 * @untyped_decorator
 * def greet(name: str) -> str:
 *     return f"Hello, {name}!"
 * ```
 *
 * If making a PR to the third-party library to improve their annotations is not possible, fixes for
 * this diagnostic could include writing your own decorator or introducing a type-safe wrapper:
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Callable
 * from typing import TypeVar
 *
 * from third_party_library import untyped_decorator
 *
 *
 * FunctionT = TypeVar("FunctionT", bound=Callable[..., object])

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Checks for classes definitions which will fail at runtime due to "instance memory layout conflicts".
 *
 * This error is usually caused by attempting to combine multiple classes that define non-empty
 * `__slots__` in a class's [Method Resolution Order][method-resolution-order] (MRO), or by attempting
 * to combine multiple builtin classes in a class's MRO.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * Inheriting from bases with conflicting instance memory layouts will lead to a `TypeError` at
 * runtime.
 *
 * An instance memory layout conflict occurs when CPython cannot determine the memory layout instances
 * of a class should have, because the instance memory layout of one of its bases conflicts with the
 * instance memory layout of one or more of its other bases.
 *
 * For example, if a Python class defines non-empty `__slots__`, this will impact the memory layout of
 * instances of that class. Multiple inheritance from more than one different class defining non-empty
 * `__slots__` is not allowed:
 *
 * ```python
 * class A:
 *     __slots__ = ("a", "b")
 *
 *
 * class B:
 *     __slots__ = ("a", "b")  # Even if the values are the same
 *
 *
 * # TypeError: multiple bases have instance lay-out conflict
 * class C(A, B): ...  # error
 * ```
 *
 * An instance layout conflict can also be caused by attempting to use multiple inheritance with two
 * builtin classes, due to the way that these classes are implemented in a CPython C extension:
 *
 * ```python
 * # TypeError: multiple bases have instance lay-out conflict
 * class A(int, float): ...  # error
 * ```
 *
 * Note that pure-Python classes with no `__slots__`, or pure-Python classes with empty `__slots__`,
 * are always compatible:
 *
 * ```python
 * class A: ...
 *
 *
 * class B:
 *     __slots__ = ()
 *
 *
 * class C:
 *     __slots__ = ("a", "b")
 *
 *
 * # fine
 * class D(A, B, C): ...
 * ```
 *
 * ## Known problems
 *
 * Classes whose `__slots__` values cannot be determined statically are not always considered disjoint
 * bases by ty. Static definitions can include string literals, fixed-length tuples, and literal lists,
 * sets, or dictionaries of string literals.
 *
 * Additionally, this check is not exhaustive: many C extensions (including several in the standard
 * library) define classes that use extended memory layouts and thus cannot coexist in a single MRO.
 * Since it is currently not possible to represent this fact in stub files, having a full knowledge of
 * these classes is also impossible. When it comes to classes that do not define `__slots__` at the
 * Python level, therefore, ty, currently only hard-codes a number of cases where it knows that a class
 * will produce instances with an atypical memory layout.

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Checks for parameters that appear to be attempting to use the legacy convention to specify that a
 * parameter is positional-only, but do so incorrectly.
 *
 * The "legacy convention" for specifying positional-only parameters was specified in
 * [PEP 484][pep-484]. It states that parameters with names starting with `__` should be considered
 * positional-only by type checkers. [PEP 570][pep-570], introduced in Python 3.8, added dedicated
 * syntax for specifying positional-only parameters, rendering the legacy convention obsolete. However,
 * some codebases may still use the legacy convention for compatibility with older Python versions.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * In most cases, a type checker will not consider a parameter to be positional-only if it comes after
 * a positional-or-keyword parameter, even if its name starts with `__`. This may be unexpected to the
 * author of the code.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```python
 * # `__y` is not considered positional-only
 * def f(x, __y):  # error

 * ```
 *
 * Use instead:

 * ```python

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects method overrides that violate the
 * [Liskov Substitution Principle][liskov-substitution-principle] ("LSP").
 *
 * The LSP states that an instance of a subtype should be substitutable for an instance of its
 * supertype. Applied to Python, this means:
 *
 * 1. All argument combinations a superclass method accepts must also be accepted by an overriding
 *     subclass method.
 * 1. The return type of an overriding subclass method must be a subtype of the return type of the
 *     superclass method.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * Violating the Liskov Substitution Principle will lead to many of ty's assumptions and inferences
 * being incorrect, which will mean that it will fail to catch many possible type errors in your code.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```python
 * class Super:
 *     def method(self, x) -> int:
 *         return 42
 *
 *
 * class Sub(Super):
 *     # Liskov violation: `str` is not a subtype of `int`,
 *     # but the supertype method promises to return an `int`.
 *     def method(self, x) -> str:  # error: [invalid-method-override]
 *         return "foo"
 *
 *
 * def accepts_super(s: Super) -> int:
 *     return s.method(x=42)
 *
 *
 * # The result of this call is a string, but ty will infer it to be an `int`
 * # due to the violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.
 * accepts_super(Sub())
 *
 *
 * class Sub2(Super):
 *     # Liskov violation: the superclass method can be called with a `x=`
 *     # keyword argument, but the subclass method does not accept it.
 *     def method(self, y) -> int:  # error: [invalid-method-override]
 *         return 42
 *
 *
 * # TypeError at runtime: method() got an unexpected keyword argument 'x'
 * # ty cannot catch this error due to the violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.
 * accepts_super(Sub2())
 * ```
 *
 * ## Common issues
 *
 * ### Why does ty complain about my `__eq__` method?
 *
 * `__eq__` and `__ne__` methods in Python are generally expected to accept arbitrary objects as their
 * second argument, for example:
 *
 * ```python
 * class A:
 *     x: int
 *
 *     def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
 *         # gracefully handle an object of an unexpected type
 *         # without raising an exception
 *         if not isinstance(other, A):
 *             return False
 *         return self.x == other.x
 * ```
 *
 * If `A.__eq__` here were annotated as only accepting `A` instances for its second argument, it would
 * imply that you wouldn't be able to use `==` between instances of `A` and instances of unrelated
 * classes without an exception possibly being raised. While some classes in Python do indeed behave
 * this way, the strongly held convention is that it should be avoided wherever possible. As part of
 * this check, therefore, ty enforces that `__eq__` and `__ne__` methods accept `object` as their
 * second argument.
 *
 * ### Why does ty disagree with Ruff about how to write my method?
 *
 * Ruff has several rules that will encourage you to rename a parameter, or change its type signature,
 * if it thinks you're falling into a certain anti-pattern. For example, Ruff's
 * [ARG002](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-method-argument/) rule recommends that an unused
 * parameter should either be removed or renamed to start with `_`. Applying either of these
 * suggestions can cause ty to start reporting an `invalid-method-override` error if the function in
 * question is a method on a subclass that overrides a method on a superclass, and the change would
 * cause the subclass method to no longer accept all argument combinations that the superclass method
 * accepts.
 *
 * This can usually be resolved by adding [`@typing.override`][override] to your method definition.
 * Ruff knows that a method decorated with `@typing.override` is intended to override a method by the
 * same name on a superclass, and avoids reporting rules like ARG002 for such methods; it knows that
 * the changes recommended by ARG002 would violate the Liskov Substitution Principle.
 *
 * Correct use of `@override` is enforced by ty's `invalid-explicit-override` rule.

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Checks for invalidly defined `NamedTuple` classes.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * An invalidly defined `NamedTuple` class may lead to the type checker drawing incorrect conclusions.
 * It may also lead to `TypeError`s or `AttributeError`s at runtime.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * A class definition cannot combine `NamedTuple` with other base classes in multiple inheritance;
 * doing so raises a `TypeError` at runtime. The sole exception to this rule is `Generic[]`, which can
 * be used alongside `NamedTuple` in a class's bases list.
 *
 * ```pycon
 * >>> from typing import NamedTuple
 * >>> class Foo(NamedTuple, object): ...
 * TypeError: can only inherit from a NamedTuple type and Generic
 * ```
 *
 * Further, `NamedTuple` field names cannot start with an underscore:
 *
 * ```pycon
 * >>> from typing import NamedTuple
 * >>> class Foo(NamedTuple):
 * ...     _bar: int
 * ValueError: Field names cannot start with an underscore: '_bar'
 * ```
 *
 * `NamedTuple` classes also have certain synthesized attributes (like `_asdict`, `_make`, `_replace`,
 * etc.) that cannot be overwritten. Attempting to assign to these attributes without a type annotation
 * will raise an `AttributeError` at runtime.
 *
 * ```pycon
 * >>> from typing import NamedTuple
 * >>> class Foo(NamedTuple):
 * ...     x: int
 * ...     _asdict = 42
 * AttributeError: Cannot overwrite NamedTuple attribute _asdict
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, `NamedTuple` field annotations cannot use the `ClassVar` or `Final` type qualifiers. These
 * qualifiers also cause a runtime error when annotations are evaluated eagerly:
 *
 * ```pycon
 * >>> from typing import ClassVar, NamedTuple
 * >>> class Foo(NamedTuple):
 * ...     x: ClassVar[int]
 * TypeError: typing.ClassVar[int] is not valid as type argument

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Checks for protocol classes that are invalid at runtime or do not satisfy the typing specification.

 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * An invalidly defined protocol class may lead to the type checker inferring unexpected things or
 * accepting unsafe operations. Some invalid protocol definitions also raise `TypeError` at runtime.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * A `Protocol` class cannot inherit from a non-`Protocol` class; this raises a `TypeError` at runtime:

 *   File "<python-input-1>", line 1, in <module>
 *     class Foo(int, Protocol): ...
 * TypeError: Protocols can only inherit from other protocols, got <class 'int'>
 * ```
 *
 * A generic protocol's declared type-variable variance must match how that variable is used by its
 * protocol members. For example, a type variable that appears only in a method's return type must be
 * covariant:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Protocol, TypeVar
 *
 * T = TypeVar("T")
 *
 *
 * class Source(Protocol[T]):  # error: [invalid-protocol]
 *     def read(self) -> T: ...
 * ```

 *
 * The name used in dependency declarations can differ from the import name: for example, the `pillow`
 * package is imported as `PIL`.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * A dependency can be installed because another package requires it. Importing that dependency without
 * declaring it makes your code rely on another package's dependency list. If that package removes the
 * dependency, your imports can fail.
 *
 * Declare the packages that provide your imports in `project.dependencies` or
 * `project.optional-dependencies` in `pyproject.toml`. Non-package files, such as tests and
 * development scripts, can also use dependencies declared in dependency groups.
 *
 * See uv's [guide to managing dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/)
 * for how to add these declarations.
 *
 * ## Rule status
 *
 * This rule is disabled by default and requires uv integration.
 *
 * For projects, enable uv workspace integration (`TY_UV=1`) and use an existing, synchronized
 * environment. Running [`uv check`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-check) synchronizes
 * the environment automatically before invoking ty, unless `--no-sync` is passed. For these checks, ty
 * reads the dependency graph and module ownership returned by `uv workspace metadata` without changing
 * installed packages. uv may update the lockfile to match the current dependency declarations. uv
 * 0.12.3 or later is required.
 *
 * For PEP 723 scripts, enable uv script integration with `TY_UV=scripts` or `TY_UV=1`. ty synchronizes
 * each script's environment and checks imports against its inline `dependencies` list. Declarations
 * and environments from the enclosing workspace or other scripts do not apply.
 *
 * ## Known limitations
 *
 * Imports guarded by `TYPE_CHECKING` are not reported because they are not executed at runtime. They
 * can use development-only dependencies, such as type stub packages, without requiring those packages
 * as runtime dependencies.
 *
 * Standard-library imports and imports whose owning package cannot be identified unambiguously are
 * also not reported.
 *
 * Imports of [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#namespace-packages)
 * themselves, such as `import ns`, are not reported: the namespace can contain modules from several
 * installable packages. Imports of their submodules, such as `import ns.child`, are checked when the
 * owning package is known. An `__init__.pyi` stub does not change this distinction.
 *
 * Native packages that ty can resolve only as namespace packages at runtime are also skipped. For
 * other native modules, ty can use stubs to resolve the import and uv's ownership map to identify
 * which package to declare.
 *
 * Some editable installations add the whole project directory to Python's import path, making both
 * package code and files such as `tests/test_app.py` importable. If uv does not identify which modules
 * belong to the installable package, ty allows dependency-group imports throughout that directory,
 * including in package code, to avoid incorrectly flagging imports in tests and scripts.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * With `requests` as a direct dependency, `urllib3` may also be installed because `requests` depends
 * on it:
 *
 * ```python {data-mdtest="ignore"}
 * import requests
 * import urllib3  # error: [missing-direct-dependency]

 *
 * ## Exemptions
 *
 * Overriding `__init__`, `__new__`, `__init_subclass__`, or `__post_init__` does not require

 *

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Checks for assignments to declared attributes that have no matching `__slots__` entry on the class
 * or its bases, and no instance dictionary to store their values.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * Most Python objects store their attributes in an "instance dictionary". Assigning to a new attribute
 * adds an entry to this dictionary; deleting that attribute removes it again. Accordingly, most Python
 * objects allow for **arbitrary attributes to be set and read**. The advantage of this is that it
 * allows for many dynamic features; the disadvantage is that it can be costly in terms of memory, and
 * can easily allow for typos to slip in accidentally, e.g.:
 *
 * ```py
 * class Foo:
 *     def __init__(self, x):
 *         self.x = x
 *
 *     def update_x(self, x):
 *         self.xx = x  # oops, this was meant to be the same attribute set in `__init__`,
 *         # but ended up being an entirely separate one!
 * ```
 *
 * Defining `__slots__` lets a class reserve space for a fixed set of instance attributes instead.
 * Unless an instance dictionary is inherited from a base class or requested by including `"__dict__"`
 * in `__slots__`, instances of the class have no dictionary in which to store additional attributes.
 * Attempting to assign to an attribute not declared in `__slots__` will often raise `AttributeError`
 * at runtime if the instance has no instance dictionary.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Class definitions
 *
 * ```python
 * class Item:
 *     __slots__ = ()
 *     value: int
 *
 *
 * Item().value = 1  # error: [missing-slot]
 * ```
 *
 * If you control the class, include the attribute in `__slots__` to make the assignment valid:
 *
 * ```python
 * class Item:
 *     __slots__ = ("value",)
 *     value: int
 *
 *
 * Item().value = 1
 * ```
 *
 * ### Stub files
 *
 * Stub files can use properties to indicate that instances have attributes that are readable and
 * writable but do not appear in `__slots__`, for example:
 *
 * ```pyi
 * class Item:
 *     __slots__ = ()
 *     @property
 *     def value(self) -> int: ...
 *     @value.setter

 *
 * ## Common issues
 *
 * ### Async generator stubs
 *
 * Calling an `async def` function whose body contains `yield` produces an async iterator, which can be
 * consumed with `async for`. Without `yield`, calling the function produces a coroutine, and its
 * return annotation describes the result of awaiting that coroutine.
 *
 * This distinction matters in stub files, where replacing the implementation with `...` removes the
 * `yield`. For example, this stub describes a coroutine function, even though its return annotation is
 * `AsyncIterator[int]`:
 *
 * `stubs.pyi`:
 *
 * ```pyi
 * from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
 *
 * async def values() -> AsyncIterator[int]: ...
 * ```
 *
 * Iterating over the coroutine is an error. An `async for` loop awaits each item; it does not
 * automatically await a coroutine to obtain the iterator:
 *
 * `main.py`:
 *
 * ```python
 * from stubs import values
 *
 *
 * async def consume() -> None:
 *     # error: "Object of type `CoroutineType[Any, Any, AsyncIterator[int]]` is not async-iterable"
 *     async for value in values():
 *         print(value)
 * ```
 *
 * To declare a function that directly produces an async iterator, use `def` rather than `async def` in
 * the stub:
 *
 * `with_def.pyi`:
 *
 * ```pyi
 * from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
 *
 * def values() -> AsyncIterator[int]: ...
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, keep `async def` and include a `yield` expression in the stub body:
 *
 * `with_yield.pyi`:
 *
 * ```pyi
 * from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
 *
 * async def values() -> AsyncIterator[int]:
 *     yield 1
 * ```
 *
 * If the function intentionally returns a coroutine that produces an async iterator, await it before
 * iterating: `async for value in await values(): ...`.

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects boolean conditions where the condition can be statically inferred to be always true or
 * always false due to the inferred type of the condition.
 *
 * This rule is enabled by default, and is deliberately not comprehensive. In order to avoid false
 * positives, it excludes conditions that meet any of these criteria:
 *
 * - The boolean test is inferred as evaluating to `True` itself, `False` itself, or an exact integer
 *     such as `1` or `0`.
 * - The boolean test can be inferred as always evaluating to `True` and `False`, but this inference is
 *     due to boolean-test short-circuiting in `if` conditions, `while` conditions or `assert` tests
 *     rather than the inferred type of the boolean test.
 * - The condition uses a walrus operator (`:=`). The assignment's side effect may be intentional, even
 *     when its result has fixed truthiness.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * A boolean condition that is always true or always false usually indicates a mistake in your code,
 * and can often lead to incorrect behavior. If an `if` condition is inferred as always false,
 * moreover, ty will infer all code within that `if` branch as being unreachable, and will not report
 * any diagnostics on code in that region.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * A common error that triggers this rule is to forget to call a function, for example:
 *
 * ```py
 * import random
 *
 *
 * def should_do_action() -> bool:
 *     return random.choice([True, False])
 *
 *
 * # oops! You forgot the parentheses here... this should have been `if should_do_action()`.
 * # Because it's not, this will always be `True`:
 * if should_do_action:  # error: [redundant-condition]
 *     print("Doing stuff...")
 * ```
 *
 * Another common mistake is to forget to `await` a coroutine:
 *
 * ```py
 * import random
 *
 *
 * async def should_do_async_action():
 *     return random.choice([True, False])
 *
 *
 * async def main():
 *     # oops! Forgot the await here... this should have been `if await should_do_async_action()`.
 *     # Because it's not, this will always be `True`:
 *     if should_do_async_action():  # error: [redundant-condition]
 *         print("Doing stuff async...")
 * ```
 *
 * Or to forget that `tuple[X]` means "A tuple with exactly one element" rather than "a tuple with an
 * arbitrary number of elements" (for which you'd use `tuple[X, ...]`):
 *
 * ```py
 * # you almost certainly meant to write `tuple[str, ...]` here rather than `tuple[str]`...
 * def consume_tuples(x: tuple[str]):
 *     # ...and that means that this later condition is inferred as always being True by ty:
 *     if x:  # error: [redundant-condition]
 *         print("Got a non-empty tuple")
 * ```
 *
 * Some Pythonistas fall into the trap of thinking that a generator expression will be falsy if it has
 * zero elements inside it -- but generator expressions are lazy, and so they're always truthy unless
 * you collect them into a tuple:
 *
 * ```py
 * def test_my_data(data: list[int]):
 *     # this will always be `True`, because the asserted object is a `types.GeneratorType` instance,
 *     # not a `tuple`! `assert any(item for item in data if item > 42)`
 *     # is probably what you meant instead.
 *     assert (item for item in data if item > 42)  # error: [redundant-condition]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Boolean operators used to compute values
 *
 * The rule checks `and` and `or` operands when the expression is used as a condition: in an `if`,
 * `elif`, `while`, or `assert` test, a conditional expression, a comprehension filter, a match guard,
 * or as the operand of `not`. It does not flag `and` or `or` expressions used to compute values --
 * even if an operand in an `and` or `or` expression is always truthy, it doesn't necessarily make the
 * expression redundant:
 *
 * ```py
 * def f(): ...
 * def g(): ...
 *
 *
 * def test(coinflip: bool):
 *     # could also be written as `func = f if coinflip else g`,
 *     # but use of an `and` expression for this is common in older codebases.
 *     func = coinflip and f or g
 *
 *     # `func` will be the `f` function if `coinflip` is `True`,
 *     # and the `g` function otherwise
 *     func()
 * ```
 *
 * This also allows calls that are deliberately always falsy but are used for their side effects:
 *
 * ```py
 * from unittest.mock import patch
 *
 *
 * def ask_to_continue() -> bool:
 *     return input("Continue? ") == "yes"
 *
 *
 * def test_ask_to_continue():
 *     prompts = []
 *     with patch(
 *         "builtins.input",
 *         side_effect=lambda prompt: prompts.append(prompt) or "yes",
 *     ):
 *         assert ask_to_continue()
 *
 *     assert prompts == ["Continue? "]
 * ```
 *
 * By contrast, `not` always produces a boolean, so we will still emit a diagnostic on the following
 * example -- negating the truthiness of a function object is pointless, since a function object is
 * always truthy:
 *
 * ```py
 * def f(): ...
 *
 *
 * value = not f  # error: [redundant-condition]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Known issues and workarounds
 *
 * This rule can sometimes trigger on code that is not incorrect, but could be written in a clearer
 * way. For example, the rule will flag this code:
 *
 * ```py
 * def find_duplicate_coordinates(coordinates: list[tuple[int, int]]):
 *     seen: set[tuple[int, int]] = set()
 *     # error: [redundant-condition] "Expression `seen.add(coord)` is always falsy (has type `None`)"
 *     duplicates = {coord for coord in coordinates if coord in seen or seen.add(coord)}
 *     print(f"Duplicates are {duplicates}")
 * ```
 *
 * The error here is triggered due to `seen.add(coord)` being used in a boolean expression, despite the
 * fact that `set.add()` always returns `None`. Here this is deliberate: `set.add()` is being used for
 * its side effect.
 *
 * To workaround this issue, the above code could be rewritten like this, which may also be easier for
 * some readers to understand:
 *
 * ```py
 * def find_duplicate_coordinates(coordinates: list[tuple[int, int]]):
 *     seen: set[tuple[int, int]] = set()
 *     duplicates: set[tuple[int, int]] = set()
 *
 *     for coord in coordinates:
 *         if coord in seen:
 *             duplicates.add(coord)
 *         else:
 *             seen.add(coord)
 *
 *     print(f"Duplicates are {duplicates}")
 * ```

export type DetectsConditionsThatAreAlwaysTruthyOrAlwaysFalsey = Level;
/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects boolean conditions where the condition can be statically inferred to be always true or
 * always false.
 *
 * This rule is disabled by default. It exclusively covers cases that its sibling (enabled-by-default)
 * rule `redundant-condition` does not cover. These cases often flag real bugs in user code, but also
 * have a significantly higher rate of unavoidable false positives than other cases.
 *
 * This rule reports redundant conditions that meet any of these criteria:
 *
 * - The boolean test is inferred as evaluating to `True` itself, `False` itself, or an exact integer
 *     such as `1` or `0`.
 * - Short-circuit evaluation means the condition can be guaranteed to be always truthy or always falsy
 *     despite fixed truthiness not being guaranteed by the inferred type of the expression's value
 *     (see "Short-circuiting boolean conditions" below for an example).
 * - The condition uses a walrus operator (`:=`). The assignment's side effect may be intentional, even
 *     when its result has fixed truthiness.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * A boolean condition that is always true or always false usually indicates a mistake in your code,
 * and can often lead to incorrect behavior. If an `if` condition is inferred as always false,
 * moreover, ty will infer all code within that `if` branch as being unreachable, and will not report
 * any diagnostics on code in that region.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * A common error in Python code is to make the mistake of thinking that indexing into a `bytes` object
 * will get you an object of type `bytes`. But `bytes` work differently to `str`s in Python -- although
 * a string is a sequence of strings, a bytestring is a sequence of `int`s, so indexing into a `bytes`
 * object gives you an `int`. This rule can catch that error by alerting you to the fact that checking
 * whether a `bytes` object is unequal to an `int` will always evaluate to `True`:
 *
 * ```py
 * def validate_record(data: bytes) -> None:
 *     if data[0] != b"\x1e":  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 *         raise ValueError("Invalid record separator")
 * ```
 *
 * Another common mistake is to assume that annotating `**kwargs` with `dict[str, str]` describes the
 * dictionary containing the keyword arguments. In fact, a `**kwargs` annotation describes each
 * individual keyword argument, so this annotation says that every value is itself a dictionary.
 * Comparing one of those values with a string will therefore always evaluate to `False`:
 *
 * ```py
 * def trace(**kwargs: dict[str, str]) -> None:
 *     if kwargs.get("operation") == "task":  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 *         print("Tracing task")
 * ```
 *
 * ## Short-circuiting boolean conditions
 *
 * In some situations, ty can know that a condition will always be true, or it can know that a
 * condition will always be false, even when this is not guaranteed by the inferred type of that
 * condition. This is because of the way that Python short-circuits evaluation of conditions in the
 * context of `if` tests, `while` tests and `assert` statements.
 *
 * Consider a class whose comparison method has an `object` return type:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing_extensions import reveal_type
 *
 *
 * class Comparable:
 *     def __lt__(self, other: int) -> object: ...
 *
 *
 * def check(value: Comparable):
 *     reveal_type(value < 1 < 0)  # revealed: ~AlwaysTruthy
 *
 *     if value < 1 < 0:  # error: [redundant-condition-strict] "always false"
 *         pass
 * ```
 *
 * Outside the context of an `if` test, the revealed type of the condition here is `~AlwaysTruthy`: in
 * other words, ty knows that this expression is not *always true*, but cannot guarantee that it is
 * definitely *always false*. It could be an object that is sometimes true and sometimes false -- for
 * example, a `list` (which is falsy when it is empty, and truthy otherwise).
 *
 * Nonetheless, when `value < 1 < 0` is used directly as a condition, ty knows that the condition will
 * always be falsy and the `if` branch will never be taken. Python tests the truthiness of the object
 * returned by `Comparable.__lt__` once: if it is falsy, the condition fails immediately. If it is
 * truthy, Python evaluates `1 < 0`, which is false. There is no second truthiness test of the object
 * returned by `__lt__`.
 *
 * If the chained comparison is saved as a variable first, its value can be the object returned by
 * `__lt__`, if that object was falsy when first tested. The `if result` statement then tests that
 * object's truthiness again. A user-defined `__bool__` method can return a different result on that
 * second call, so ty cannot guarantee that the saved value is still falsy, and no diagnostic is
 * emitted:
 *
 * ```py
 * def check_saved(value: Comparable):
 *     result = value < 1 < 0
 *     if result:  # no diagnostic
 *         pass
 * ```
 *
 * ## Exemptions
 *
 * Like `redundant-condition`, this rule checks subexpressions of an `and` or `or` expression only when
 * the outer expression is used as a condition. This is to avoid emitting false-positive diagnostics on
 * code like the following, where the `and` expression is clearly not redundant despite the fact that
 * both `CONSTANT_1` and `CONSTANT_2` are always truthy:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Final
 *
 *
 * CONSTANT_1: Final = 1
 * CONSTANT_2: Final = 2
 *
 *
 * def do_something(coinflip: bool):
 *     # could also be written as `constant_to_use = CONSTANT_1 if coinflip else CONSTANT_2`,
 *     # but use of an `and` expression for this is common in older codebases.
 *     constant_to_use = coinflip and CONSTANT_1 or CONSTANT_2
 *
 *     # do something with `constant_to_use` now...
 *     ...
 * ```
 *
 * Unlike `and` and `or`, however, `not` explicitly converts its operand to a boolean, so the rule
 * checks `not` expressions in every context.
 *
 * Another exemption applied by this rule concerns `assert`-statement tests. A common pattern in Python
 * code is to use defensive `assert`s to enforce behaviour at runtime, even when the asserted condition
 * can be inferred statically to be always true. For example:
 *
 * ```py
 * def add_one(x: int) -> int:
 *     assert isinstance(x, int)  # no diagnostic
 *     return x + 1
 * ```
 *
 * This kind of defensive behaviour is often reasonable, since the author of a library cannot guarantee
 * that end users of the library will run a type checker on code calling into the library, meaning that
 * it's entirely possible at runtime for an object passed into the `x`a parameter above to be a `str`
 * (for example) even though the parameter annotation states that only `int`s can ever be passed in.
 * This rule therefore also exempts all assertion tests or subexpressions that evaluate to a subtype of
 * `int` or `bool`:
 *
 * `redundant-condition-strict` can still trigger on `assert` statements in some contexts, however. For
 * example, `redundant-condition-strict` will be emitted on the below example, where the left-hand side
 * of the `and` expression is always true and not a subtype of `bool` or `int`, but where the condition
 * is nonetheless excluded from the enabled-by-default `redundant-condition` rule due to the use of the
 * walrus operator:
 *
 * ```py
 * def func() -> bool:
 *     return True
 *
 *
 * def test_func():
 *     assert (result := func) and result != func()  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 * ```
 *
 * For similar reasons to the `assert` exemptions, this rule also exempts always-false `if` or `elif`
 * conditions when their bodies end in a defensive check: a `raise`, an assertion that could fail, a
 * call returning `Never`, an `await` to a call returning `Never`, or `return NotImplemented`:
 *
 * ```py
 * import sys
 *
 *
 * def add_two(x: int) -> int:
 *     if not isinstance(x, int):  # no diagnostic
 *         raise TypeError("need an int!!")
 *     return x + 2
 *
 *
 * def add_three(x: int) -> int:
 *     if not isinstance(x, int):  # no diagnostic
 *         assert False, "unreachable"
 *     return x + 3
 *
 *
 * def add_four(x: int) -> int:
 *     if not isinstance(x, int):  # no diagnostic
 *         sys.exit(1)
 *     return x + 4
 *
 *
 * class Foo:
 *     def __init__(self, data: int):
 *         self.data = data
 *
 *     def __add__(self, other: "Foo"):
 *         if not isinstance(other, Foo):  # no diagnostic
 *             return NotImplemented
 *         return Foo(self.data + other.data)
 * ```
 *
 * And an exemption is applied for always-true `if` or `elif` statements that are followed by branches
 * which contain defensive checks:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing_extensions import assert_never
 *
 *
 * def parse_data(data: int | str):
 *     if isinstance(data, int):
 *         print("got an int")
 *     elif isinstance(data, str):  # Always true, but no diagnostic, since
 *         # the `else` branch following this branch is always terminal.
 *         # (`assert_never` returns `Never`, indicating that it always raises an exception)
 *         print("got a str")
 *     else:
 *         assert_never(data)
 *
 *
 * def parse_data_early_return(data: int | str):
 *     if isinstance(data, int):
 *         print("got an int")
 *         return
 *
 *     # Always true, but no diagnostic, since
 *     # the suite following this branch is always terminal
 *     # (every control-flow path following this `if` statement ends in a `raise` statement)
 *     if isinstance(data, str):
 *         print("got a str")
 *         return
 *
 *     raise AssertionError("unexpected data")
 * ```
 *
 * Any conditions defined in relation to `sys.version_info`, `sys.platform`, `os.name` or
 * `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` are also exempted. The rule recursively follows the definitions of names and
 * attributes across module boundaries to determine if a name or attribute was indirectly defined in
 * relation to one of these highly special-cased symbols:
 *
 * ```toml
 * [environment]
 * python-version = "3.14"
 * python-platform = "linux"
 * ```
 *
 * ```py
 * import os
 * import sys
 * from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
 *
 * if sys.version_info >= (3, 14):  # inferred as always true here, but no diagnostic
 *     pass
 *
 * if sys.platform == "win32":  # inferred as always false here, but no diagnostic
 *     pass
 *
 * LINE_ENDING = "\n" if os.name == "posix" else "\r\n"
 *
 * if LINE_ENDING == "\n":  # inferred as always true here, but no diagnostic
 *     pass
 *
 * if TYPE_CHECKING:  # inferred as always true, but no diagnostic
 *     pass
 * ```
 *
 * Conditions involving these constants, or conditions involving values defined in relation to these
 * constants, can often be inferred as always-true or always-false by ty. Indeed, these conditions
 * usually *will* be always true or always false across a single invocation run of a Python programme.
 * Nonetheless, Python code is often written so that it can work on multiple different Python versions
 * and/or multiple different operating systems, and a condition that is always true on one operating
 * system might very well be always false on another operating system (for example). Flagging these
 * conditions as being always true or always false would only add noise: the aim of the rule is to flag
 * conditions that are *unintentionally* always true or always false.
 *
 * Lastly, some conditions involving literal integers and booleans in the AST are also exempted:
 * there's no reason why you'd use a condition like this unless it was intentional.
 *
 * ```py
 * if True:  # inferred as always true (obviously), but no diagnostic
 *     pass
 *
 * if 0:
 *     pass  # inferred as always false, but no diagnostic
 * ```

 * This rule can often trigger on code that is not incorrect, but could be written in a clearer way.
 * For example, the rule will flag this code:
 *
 * ```py
 * from enum import Enum
 *
 *
 * class YesOrNo(Enum):
 *     YES = 1
 *     NO = 0
 *
 *
 * def say_yes_or_no(what_to_say: YesOrNo):
 *     if what_to_say == YesOrNo.YES:
 *         print("yes")
 *     elif what_to_say == YesOrNo.NO:  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 *         print("no")
 * ```
 *
 * This snippet could be written more clearly as this, which would not trigger the rule owing to the
 * exemptions described in the section above:
 *
 * ```py
 * def say_yes_or_no(what_to_say: YesOrNo):
 *     if what_to_say == YesOrNo.YES:
 *         print("yes")
 *     else:
 *         assert what_to_say == YesOrNo.NO
 *         print("no")
 * ```
 *
 * or the snippet could also be rewritten as this, which would also be fine according to the rule's
 * heuristics:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing_extensions import assert_never
 *
 *
 * def say_yes_or_no(what_to_say: YesOrNo):
 *     if what_to_say == YesOrNo.YES:
 *         print("yes")
 *     elif what_to_say == YesOrNo.NO:
 *         print("no")
 *     else:
 *         assert_never(what_to_say)
 * ```
 *
 * In a similar vein, this rule can often flag `and` or `or` expressions that have operands which are
 * deliberately always truthy or deliberately always falsy, because the purpose of the operand is to
 * have some side effect occur. For example:
 *
 * ```py
 * import random
 * from typing import Literal
 *
 *
 * def want_to_go_fishing() -> bool:
 *     return random.choice([True, False])
 *
 *
 * def weather_report() -> Literal["rainy", "sunny", "cloudy"]:
 *     return random.choice(["rainy", "sunny", "cloudy"])
 *
 *
 * def have_fishing_supplies() -> bool:
 *     return random.choice([True, False])
 *
 *
 * def main():
 *     if (
 *         want_to_go_fishing()
 *         and (weather := weather_report())  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 *         and have_fishing_supplies()
 *     ):
 *         print(f"The weather is {weather}, let's go fishing")
 * ```
 *
 * The middle operand in the above `and` expression is always truthy. This might be deliberate, but
 * even if it is, the function would arguably be clearer if it were written like this instead:
 *
 * ```py
 * def main():
 *     if want_to_go_fishing():
 *         weather = weather_report()
 *         if have_fishing_supplies():
 *             print(f"The weather is {weather}, let's go fishing")
 * ```
 *
 * Lastly, the rule cannot reliably distinguish in all cases comparisons that are intentionally always
 * true/false from those that are unintentionally always true/false. The rule takes care to avoid
 * flagging code that uses `if TYPE_CHECKING`, `if sys.version_info < (X, Y)`, `if sys.platform == ...`
 * and `if os.name == ...`. But it cannot reliably determine that code like this was written the way it
 * was meant to be:
 *
 * ```py
 * DEBUGGING = 0
 *
 * if DEBUGGING:  # error: [redundant-condition-strict]
 *     print("Doing debugging stuff...")
 * ```

/**
 * ## What it does

 * Detects suspicious truthiness tests of `Callable`-typed values and unions of callable types.

 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * `Callable`-typed variables are nearly always functions in practice, and functions are always truthy.
 * If `predicate` is a variable inferred as having a `Callable` type, therefore, a boolean test such as
 * `if predicate:` is usually not what you want; `if predicate()` (or similar) is usually what was
 * intended.
 *
 * ## Examples

 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Callable

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects boolean conditions where variables typed as `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `Generator` or similar
 * are tested for their truthiness.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * Testing an `Iterable` object for truthiness strongly suggests that the code expects the object to
 * evaluate as falsy in a boolean context if it is empty. However, even empty `Iterable` objects can be
 * truthy if they do not define `__len__` or `__bool__`. The classic example of this is a generator:
 * unevaluated generators in Python are always truthy, even if they do not yield any elements at
 * runtime.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Iterable
 *
 *
 * def process(items: Iterable[int]):
 *     if items:  # error: [truthiness-test-of-iterable]
 *         print("Received items")
 *     else:
 *         print("Didn't receive any items")
 *
 *
 * # prints "Received items", even though the passed-in generator is empty!
 * process(x for x in range(42) if x > 43)
 * ```
 *
 * If `process` in the above example does not need to accept generators, one solution is to rewrite the
 * annotation to use `Collection` instead of `Iterable`. `Collection` mandates that the object passed
 * in must define `__len__`, making a truthiness test much more likely to be meaningful:
 *
 * ```py
 * from collections.abc import Collection
 *
 *
 * def process(items: Collection[int]):
 *     if items:  # no diagnostic
 *         print("Received items")
 *     else:
 *         print("Didn't receive any items")
 *
 *
 * # passing in a generator is now rejected:
 * # error: [invalid-argument-type] "Expected `Collection[int]`, found `GeneratorType[int, None, None]`"
 * process(x for x in range(42) if x > 43)
 * ```
 *
 * If the function must also accept generators, another solution can be to collect the iterable into a
 * tuple or list before testing its length:
 *
 * ```py
 * def process(items: Iterable[int]):
 *     collected = tuple(items)
 *     if collected:  # no diagnostic
 *         print("Received items")
 *     else:
 *         print("Didn't receive any items")
 *
 *
 * # correctly prints "Didn't receive any items"
 * process(x for x in range(42) if x > 43)
 * ```

 * ## What it does

 * ## What it does

 * Detects variable assignments that unsoundly assign a type that is not a [subtype] of a variable's

 * attributes and subscripts, however, this rule is only applied to variable assignments.
 *
 * This rule has no effect on stub files.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * By default, type checkers consider an assignment valid if the inferred type of the assigned value is
 * [assignable] to the target's declared type. However, this makes it easy for incorrect types to
 * percolate through your code unexpectedly due to a single expression being inferred as `Any`. This
 * can easily lead to runtime errors that are not caught by the type checker:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return "not an integer"
 *
 *
 * # error: "Unsound assignment: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 * my_integer: int = returns_any()
 *
 * # Fails at runtime, even though the type checker infers both operands as being of type `int`!
 * my_integer + 42
 * ```
 *
 * This rule treats ["fully static"][fully-static] declared types as "typed boundaries" for your code.
 * With this rule enabled, ty would emit an error on the `my_integer: int = returns_any()` assignment,
 * since the `returns_any()` call is inferred as having type `Any`, and `Any` is not a subtype of
 * `int`. This helps prevent the unsoundness from spreading far from its original source (in this case,
 * the return type of the `returns_any` function).
 *
 * Note that this rule is only applied to assignments where the declared type is
 * [fully static][fully-static]. It will not trigger if `Any` or `Unknown` appear anywhere in the
 * declared type, either implicitly or explicitly:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return "not an integer"
 *
 *
 * explicitly_dynamic: Any = returns_any()  # no error
 * also_dynamic: list[Any] = returns_any()  # no error
 *
 * # no `unsound-assignment` error, since `list` is implicitly the same as `list[Unknown]`
 * # (which is what the `missing-type-argument` error is complaining about)
 * #
 * # error: [missing-type-argument]
 * implicitly_dynamic: list = returns_any()
 * ```
 *
 * This rule works especially well when combined with ty's `missing-type-argument` rule.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return 42
 *
 *
 * # error: "Unsound assignment: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 * my_integer: int = returns_any()
 *
 * another_integer: int
 *
 * # error: "Unsound assignment: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 * another_integer = returns_any()
 * ```
 *
 * Narrow the value before assigning it to fix the diagnostics:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return 42
 *
 *
 * value = returns_any()
 * assert isinstance(value, int)
 * my_integer: int = value  # no error: `Any & int` is a subtype of `int`

 * out of a function unless that function has been *explicitly* annotated with a dynamic type in some
 * way (`-> Any` or `-> tuple[Any]`, for example).
 *
 * This rule is analogous to mypy's [`no-any-return`][no-any-return] error code, which is enabled by
 * mypy’s [`--strict`][mypy-strict] mode and can also be enabled on its own using mypy’s
 * [`--warn-return-any`][warn-return-any] option.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return 42
 *
 *
 * def returns_int() -> int:
 *     # error: "Unsound return statement: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 *     return returns_any()
 * ```
 *
 * Narrow the type to a subtype of `int` to fix the diagnostic:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any
 * from typing_extensions import reveal_type
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return 42
 *
 *
 * def returns_int() -> int:
 *     my_int = returns_any()
 *     assert isinstance(my_int, int)
 *     reveal_type(my_int)  # revealed: Any & int
 *     return my_int  # no error: `Any & int` is a subtype of `int`
 * ```
 *
 * ## Default level
 *
 * This rule is disabled by default. It is intended for advanced users wanting additional soundness
 * checks from their type checker, not for users who have just started to use type checkers on their
 * Python code.

/**
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Detects `yield` and `yield from` expressions that unsoundly yield a type that is not a [subtype] of
 * the generator function's annotated yield type.
 *
 * This lint is a stricter version of `invalid-yield`.
 *
 * ## Why is this bad?
 *
 * By default, type checkers consider a yielded value valid if its inferred type is [assignable] to the
 * generator's annotated yield type. However, this makes it easy for incorrect types to percolate
 * through your code unexpectedly due to a single expression being inferred as `Any`. This can easily
 * lead to runtime errors that are not caught by the type checker:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any, Generator
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return "not an integer"
 *
 *
 * def integers() -> Generator[int]:
 *     # error: "Unsound `yield`: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 *     yield returns_any()
 *
 *
 * # Fails at runtime, even though the type checker infers `integers` as yielding only `int`s!
 * sum(integers())
 * ```
 *
 * This rule treats ["fully static"][fully-static] yield types as "typed boundaries" for your code.
 * With this rule enabled, ty would emit an error on the `yield returns_any()` statement in `integers`,
 * since the `returns_any()` call is inferred as having type `Any`, and `Any` is not a subtype of
 * `int`. This helps prevent the unsoundness from spreading far from its original source (in this case,
 * the return type of the `returns_any` function).
 *
 * Note that this rule is only applied to functions annotated as yielding [fully static][fully-static]
 * types. It will not trigger if `Any` or `Unknown` appear anywhere in your function's yield type,
 * either implicitly or explicitly. It will still trigger on functions that have non-fully-static send
 * and/or return types, however:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any, Generator
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return "not an integer"
 *
 *
 * def dynamic_yield_type() -> Generator[Any]:
 *     # no error
 *     yield returns_any()
 *
 *
 * def static_yield_type() -> Generator[int, Any, Any]:
 *     # error: "Unsound `yield`: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 *     yield returns_any()
 * ```
 *
 * This rule works especially well when combined with ty's `missing-type-argument` and
 * `unsound-assignment` rules, as well as the Ruff rules [`ANN201`][ann201], [`ANN202`][ann202],
 * [`ANN204`][ann204], [`ANN205`][ann205], and [`ANN206`][ann206]. Enabling all these rules at once
 * effectively makes it much less likely that a `yield` expression can lead to unsoundness "leaking"
 * out of a function unless that function has been *explicitly* annotated with a dynamic type in some
 * way (`-> Generator[Any]` or `-> Generator[tuple[Any]]`, for example).
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any, Iterator
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return "foo"
 *
 *
 * def any_iterator() -> Iterator[Any]:
 *     yield "foo"
 *
 *
 * def integers() -> Iterator[int]:
 *     # error: "Unsound `yield`: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 *     yield returns_any()
 *     # error: "Unsound `yield from`: `Any` is not a subtype of `int`"
 *     yield from any_iterator()
 * ```
 *
 * Narrow the value before yielding it to fix the diagnostics:
 *
 * ```py
 * from typing import Any, Iterator
 *
 *
 * def returns_any() -> Any:
 *     return 42
 *
 *
 * def any_iterator() -> Iterator[Any]:
 *     yield "foo"
 *
 *
 * def integers() -> Iterator[int]:
 *     value = returns_any()
 *     assert isinstance(value, int)
 *     yield value
 *
 *     for value in any_iterator():
 *         assert isinstance(value, int)
 *         yield value
 * ```

   * Configure ty's behavior regarding type inference and narrowing of equality

   *
   * By default, ty makes various assumptions about equality checks that match the
   * intuitions of most Python programmers, but may not be fully sound in all situations.
   * Enabling this option makes ty more conservative about these assumptions, making it
   * less likely to infer `Literal[True]` or `Literal[False]` as the result of an
   * equality check. This has various effects on type checking, including fewer type
   * narrowing opportunities and more conservative assumptions regarding control flow.
   *
   * One way in which ty will by default make unsound assumptions is by narrowing an
   * object `x` of type `str` to `Literal["a"]` after an `if x == "a"` check. This is
   * unsound because a subclass of `str` with value `"a"` will (by default) compare equal
   * to `"a"`, but will not be of type `Literal["a"]`:
   *
   * ```pycon
   * >>> # `Literal["a"]` can only be inhabited by instances of exactly `str`, not
   * >>> # subclasses, but str subclasses compare equal by default:
   * >>> class StringSubclass(str): ...
   * ...
   * >>> StringSubclass("a") == "a"
   * True
   * >>>
   * >>> # This also applies to `StrEnum`s:
   * >>> from enum import StrEnum
   * >>> class MyEnum(StrEnum):
   * ...     A = "a"
   * ...
   * >>> MyEnum.A == "a"
   * True
   * ```
   *
   * Enabling this option prevents the unsound narrowing of `x` to `Literal["a"]`,
   * and instead keeps it as `str`:
   *
   * ```python
   * from typing import Literal
   *
   * def parse(value: str) -> Literal["a"] | None:
   *     # with `strict-equality-semantics = true`, no narrowing will occur here,
   *     # and an error will be emitted on the `return` statement.
   *     if value == "a":
   *         return value
   *     return None
   * ```
   *
   * Another assumption ty makes by default is that subclasses will never override `__eq__` or
   * `__ne__`. This allows ty to narrow the following union based on an equality check, despite
   * the fact that an instance of a subclass of `Foo` could compare equal to `None`, and it's
   * perfectly valid to pass an instance of a subclass into the `x` parameter of this function:
   *
   * ```python
   * def narrow(x: Foo | None, other: Foo) -> None:
   *     if x == other:
   *         # with this option enabled, `x` will still have type `Foo | None` here,
   *         # since it is legal to subclass `Foo` and override its `__eq__` method.
   *         reveal_type(x)
   * ```
   *
   * Many operations in Python implicitly call `__eq__` under the hood; enabling this option
   * will also impact those operations. For example, this option will also impact narrowing from
   * `in` checks, and narrowing in `match` statements that use value patterns:
   *
   * ```python
   * def narrow_in(x: Foo | None, other: list[Foo]) -> None:
   *     if x in other:
   *         # with this option enabled, `x` will still have type `Foo | None` here,
   *         # since the `in` operator implicitly calls `__eq__` on each element of `other`.
   *         reveal_type(x)
   *
   *
   * def narrow_match(x: str) -> None:
   *     match x:
   *         case "a":
   *             # with this option enabled, `x` will still have type `str` here,
   *             # since this `case` branch will be taken by any object that compares
   *             # equal to `"a"`, including subclasses of `str`.

   *
   * - `./src/` matches only a directory
   * - `./src` matches both files and directories
   * - `src` matches files or directories named `src`
   * - `*` matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters (except `/`).
   * - `**` matches zero or more path components.
   *   This sequence **must** form a single path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result in an error.
   *   A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
   * - `?` matches any single character except `/`
   * - `[abc]` matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode,
   *   so e.g. `[0-9]` specifies any character between `0` and `9` inclusive. An unclosed bracket is invalid.
   * - `!pattern` negates a pattern (undoes the exclusion of files that would otherwise be excluded)
   *
   * All paths are anchored relative to the project root (`src` only
   * matches `<project_root>/src` and not `<project_root>/test/src`).
   * To exclude any directory or file named `src`, use `** /src` instead.
   *
   * By default, ty excludes commonly ignored directories:
   *
   * - `** /.bzr/`
   * - `** /.direnv/`
   * - `** /.eggs/`
   * - `** /.git/`

   * - `*` matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters (except `/`).
   * - `**` matches zero or more path components.
   *   This sequence **must** form a single path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result in an error.
   *   A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
   * - `?` matches any single character except `/`
   * - `[abc]` matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode,
   *   so e.g. `[0-9]` specifies any character between `0` and `9` inclusive. An unclosed bracket is invalid.
   *
   * All paths are anchored relative to the project root (`src` only
   * matches `<project_root>/src` and not `<project_root>/test/src`).
   *
   * `exclude` takes precedence over `include`.
